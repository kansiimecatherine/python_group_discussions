# PYTHON DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
# Loops
# Basic: Write a Python program that prints all even numbers between 1 and 20 using a for loop.
# Intermediate: Use a while loop to ask the user to input a number until they provide a number greater than 10.
# Advanced: Write a program that prints the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) for numbers from 1 to 5 using nested for loops.
# Challenge: Given a list of integers, [4, 7, 2, 9, 12, 15], write a program using a for loop to find the sum of all odd numbers and print the result.

# Lists
# Basic: Create a list of 5 fruits and print each fruit on a new line using a for loop.
# Intermediate: Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with each number squared. Example: [1, 2, 3] should become [1, 4, 9].
# Advanced: Write a Python program that takes two lists, list1 = [1, 2, 3] and list2 = [4, 5, 6], and combines them into a single list, combined = [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6].

# Challenge: Given a list of numbers, [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2], write a program to find and print the two largest numbers in the list without using the max() function.

# Dictionaries
# Basic: Create a dictionary with three key-value pairs representing a student's information: name, age, and grade.
#  Print each key-value pair on a new line.
# Intermediate: Write a function that takes a dictionary of people's names and their ages, {'Alice': 24, 'Bob': 19, 'Charlie': 30}, and returns a list of names of people who are 21 or older.
# Advanced: Given a dictionary representing items in a store with their prices,
#  {'apple': 0.5, 'banana': 0.3, 'orange': 0.7}, write a program that takes a list of items bought,
#  ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'banana'], and calculates the total cost.
# Challenge: Write a program that counts the occurrences of each word in a given sentence. Example: for the sentence "hello world hello," the output should be {'hello': 2, 'world': 1}.

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
# Basic: Create a class called Car with attributes brand and color. Instantiate an object of the Car class and print its attributes.
# Intermediate: Add a method called start_engine to the Car class that prints a message saying the engine 
# of the car has started. Create an instance of Car and call the method.
# Advanced: Create a class called BankAccount with attributes account_number and balance. Add methods to:
# Deposit an amount.
# Withdraw an amount (only if sufficient balance exists).
# Print the account balance.
# Challenge: Implement a class called Library that manages a collection of books. Each book has a title, author, 
# and available status. The Library class should have methods to:
# Add a book to the library.
# Remove a book from the library.
# Check if a book is available by title.
# Borrow a book (mark it as unavailable if itâ€™s available).
# Return a book (mark it as available again if it was borrowed).
